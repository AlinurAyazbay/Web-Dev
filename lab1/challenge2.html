        <p class="post">It is 2023, 24th of July, my 17th birthday. As we were having a flight at night, we decided to not celebrate my birthday, to be honest I am already used to not celebrate my birthday. We flew at night, more precisely in the morning of 25th of July. Therefore, the burj halifa the highest building in the world was visible from the plane. After landing on the airport we had a extra bus road to our hotel that took 3 hours, we were exhausted. After caming to hotel we had a launch and checked into the room. We had a nice room with large terrace.  </p>

The man from London invited me to his house, which is 40km to the west from the city. I also met kazakh guys from Astana, which I am still talking to, we ahd a lot og fun. We hang out together, walk together, swim together and go to the bar together.</p>

    <p class = "post2">As usual we had a flight in the morning. I do not remember my seat, was there someone sitting next to me. That feeling was awesome, when you are heading to the airport, the city streets are almost empty, and you are not able to realize  that you are eventually flying to your holiday, and you are gonna have a big fun during the next week which wait for a lot, just because you are sleepy. We came to the airport and went throught the registration and were waiting for the flight. My mom made us to make a trending family videon on a vacation, so we just backed her up. The flight was really flight, i slept all time.</p>
