let message;
message = 'Hello';
alert(message); // It shows the messaage vaiables va;ue which is Hello 

let notification = 'Hi'; // Or we can directly gave it a value 

var car = 'model';

messaage = 'World'; // we can change it as many times as we want 

let telegram;
telegram = message; // We can also copy the data 

// let message = 'marking'; <- THis would be an error, we can not use let  repeatedly
